# fletcher-snap

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/abs-tudelft/fletcher/_apis/build/status/abs-tudelft.fletcher-snap?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/abs-tudelft/fletcher/_build/latest?definitionId=6&branchName=master)

Fletcher oc-accel platform support.

This platform has been derived from https://github.com/abs-tudelft/fletcher-snap, much like oc-accel is the successor of SNAP (SNAP = CAPI 1.0 and 2.0, ocxl aka. oc-accel is OpenCAPI 3.0).

As this repo contains only the needed platform support, the main fletcher library is needed for all the platform-agnostic parts (including VHDL code, common runtime library, example hardware and software code). That repo is included as a git submodule, but you can also check it out elsewhere yourself. In that case, you need to make sure that the FLETCHER_DIR, to be set in oc-accel/env.sh, points to it.

Platform-specific changes needed in fletcher itself (patch):

Important: When you wish to run one of the examples, you will need to run `make` in the corresponding example directory in the fletcher directory. In addition, you need to add the flag `--axi` to the `fletchgen` command in the hw Makefile. Otherwise, the AxiTop file is not generated and will remain a black box. This is not an error for oc-accel so it will crash (hang) the ocse simulation without notice.
